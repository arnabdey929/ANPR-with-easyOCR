# ANPR-with-easyOCR

Here I used YOLO-v9 (or you can use any version) to detect car license plates in an image.
With the annotated bounding box, I send the cropped license plate image to EasyOCR to extract the text/digits.

It has possible usage in tolls where cameras capture every passing vehicle and using license plate detection and recognition,
all vehicles entering and exiting the city can by efficiently monitored.
